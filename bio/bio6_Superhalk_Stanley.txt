Stanley Jenna Superhalk is a 22-year-old former local activist who enjoys ferret racing, badminton and drinking. She is energetic and considerate, but can also be very violent and a bit unstable.
She is addicted to alcohol, something which her friend Caelan Oscar Rodriguez pointed out when she was 16. The problem intensified in 2017. In 2017, Stanley lost her job as a local activist as a result of her addiction.
She is a French Buddhist. She started studying philosophy, politics and economics at college but never finished the course. She is obsessed with being painted blue.
Physically, Stanley is not in great shape. She needs to lose quite a lot of weight. She is short with olive skin, mouse hair and green eyes. She has a blue inksplot tattoo on her left shoulder.
She grew up in a working class neighbourhood. Having never really known her parents, she was raised in a series of foster homes.
She is currently single. Her most recent romance was with a kitchen assistant called Edgar Grant Cooper, who was the same age as her. They broke up because Stanley felt she could get someone hotter.
Stanley's best friend is a former local activist called Caelan Rodriguez. They get on well most of the time. She also hangs around with Byron Shaw and Leonie Perry. They enjoy reading together.
