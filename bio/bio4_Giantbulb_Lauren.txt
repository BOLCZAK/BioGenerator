Lauren Susan Giantbulb is a 26-year-old junior programmer who enjoys travelling, eating and golf. She is gentle and inspiring, but can also be very disloyal and a bit selfish.
She is addicted to strawberry bonbons, something which her friend Ariel Tayte Emery pointed out when she was 16. The problem intensified in 2014.
She is a British Hindu who defines herself as bisexual. She has a post-graduate degree in computing. She is allergic to wasps. She has a severe phobia of sheep, and is obsessed with selfies.
Physically, Lauren is slightly overweight but otherwise in good shape. She is tall with cocao skin, black hair and brown eyes.
She grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. Her father left when she was young, leaving her with her mother, who was an addict.
She is currently in a relationship with Ashly Siena Ramsey. Ashly is the same age as her and works as a student.
Lauren's best friend is a junior programmer called Ariel Emery. They get on well most of the time. She also hangs around with Deven Hewitt and Greer Taylor. They enjoy jigsaw puzzles together.
